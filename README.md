# Django Chatrooms (with WebSockets)

A lightweight **real-time chat application** built using **Django, Django REST Framework, and Django Channels**.  
Each user can create **private chatrooms** that are strictly visible only to them.  
Real-time messaging is handled over **WebSockets**, while authentication uses **JWT**.
